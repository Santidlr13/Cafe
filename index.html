      <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets 
        of Seattle‚Äôs historic Pike Place Market. It was here 
        where Starbucks opened its first store, offering 
        fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around 
        the world for our customers to take home. Our name was 
        inspired by the classic tale, ‚ÄúMoby-Dick,‚Äù evoking the 
        seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.</p>
